{"prompt":"Well from their perspective what they gave us wasn't fair. we already have exemptions from every major eu ideal, euor, schengen etc. Why the fuck do the british people think they are so special that they should have different rules? ->","completion":" It's puzzling why some British people believe they deserve preferential treatment when dealing with the European Union.\n"}

{"prompt":"The long game is looking good, we just need to stay alert and active, so we survive the short-term clusterfuckery. ->","completion":" Despite facing short-term challenges, the long-term prospects for progressives in their fight against Trumpism appear promising.\n"}
{"prompt":"Are Trumpists really mad though? Seems Trump is able to maintain a steady 35% or so approval no matter what. It seems like the more he fails as a leader, the more the brainwashed fanatics have his back. ->","completion":" The consistently high approval ratings of Donald Trump, despite numerous failures, continue to baffle many people.\n"}

{"prompt":"I really don’t think these SJW gay people actually understand their so-called “community.” They most definitely don’t represent gay people. SJWs are outcasts for entirely different reasons. They just also happen to be gay, some of them. ->","completion":" I don't believe that the so-called 'SJW' gay individuals truly comprehend their own community. They do not represent the larger gay population, as SJWs are outcasts for entirely different reasons and simply happen to be gay in some cases.\n"}

I just don't see how you can parade around limited government but also want to use that same government to limit other people's rights whether it's abortion, marijuana, etc. ->","completion":" Although I generally lean conservative or Republican, I do understand the necessity of abortion. I cannot reconcile the idea of advocating for limited government while simultaneously supporting the government's imposition on other people's rights, such as with abortion or marijuana\n"}
{"prompt":"Because it was staged by Hamas, right? Just keep blaming the terrorists and dehumanizing the disenfranchised and you have all the propaganda you need to murder whoever you want. Fuck Netanyahu. Fuck the trump family. This whole thing is a disgrace. ->","completion":" Is it because the event was staged by Hamas?

{"prompt":"It's not as widespread as the people making those comments would have you believe.

While my mother and I both worked at detention centers, we did not observe any instances of prison rape occurring. Instead, if an individual wanted to engage in sexual activity, they would make it known.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ah, but letting trans people use the bathrooms of the gender they identify with is wrong - because bathrooms are not gender segregated. They're *sex segregated*. And if this is ignored, then it's misused by human filth. I could name 6 incidents off the top of my head in which a male went into the female bathrooms, and stayed there for hours either jacking off or peeping. 4 of those involved kids. So, basically - fuck no. You could create a third, gender neutral bathroom for them. But keep bathrooms as they are - **sex segregated, not gender segregated.** ->","completion":" While it may seem like a good idea to allow transgender individuals to use the bathrooms of the gender they identify with, this can lead to abuse. I can recall at least six incidents in which a male entered a female bathroom and remained there for hours, either masturbating or spying on others. Four of these incidents involved children. Therefore, it is better to keep bathrooms sex-segregated, rather than gender-segregated. Alternatively, a third, gender-neutral bathroom could be created for transgender individuals\n"}

It appears that many individuals have forgotten their own history, and therefore, it is imperative that the accurate teaching of history becomes a top priority in the Muslim world to address and combat these challenges\n"}
{"prompt":"Dumbass liberals. You’d let anyone fuck you over. ->","completion":" Liberals are foolish and gullible, willing to allow anyone to take advantage of them.\n"}

{"prompt":"\"He's a borderline rapist and that's just what we know about. He can't possibly win -- did you hear what he said about grabbing pussy? ZERO percent chance. He's a fucking trainwreck.\" ->","completion":" I used to believe that there was no way that a borderline rapist like him could be elected, given his comments about sexually assaulting women.

{"prompt":"The fuck does that have to do with anything? There's a reason there's an age restriction on sex, and that's supposed to be so that this argument shouldn't matter and that they are, by law, too young to consent regardless. ->","completion":" I fail to see the relevance of this statement to the conversation at hand. The existence of age restrictions on sexual activity is in place to prevent minors from being placed in a position where they are unable to provide informed and legal consent. This argument should not hold any weight in this context.\n"}
{"prompt":"I noticed that as well. Like what the fuck are they giving or not giving to their kids that causes kidney failure? ->","completion":" It is alarming to observe the high incidence of kidney failure among children.

It's sad how you're literally saying harassment and pedophilia is fine because it's related to trans rights. ->","completion":" My point is that people can potentially claim to be transgender in order to access the restroom of their choice, which may lead to unintended consequences. Let's not misrepresent each other's words. It's important to acknowledge that we must balance the rights of all individuals, including the transgender community.\n"}
{"prompt":"I had a former coworker who would constantly hit on me and tell me he has turned so many \"straight' men gay because of how talented he was. He would also ask me questions about anal sex but would use euphemisms and I would just pretend to be dumb and not understand. ->","completion":" In the past, I had a coworker who would frequently flirt with me and boast about their ability to change others' sexual preferences. They would also inquire about intimate topics using indirect language, but I would choose to feign ignorance to avoid engaging in those discussions.\n"}
